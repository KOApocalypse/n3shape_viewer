I compiled a new version, you can find it here (http://stephenmeier.net/files/N3ShapeViewer.zip). Unzip the folder and open a command prompt in the unzipped folder. From there I have added two example n3shape files to give you an idea on how to use it. Use the arrow keys to zoom and rotate the object.


N3ShapeViewer 0 bow.n3shape 1

N3ShapeViewer 1 repent_sword.n3shape 1


This version supports some of the n3shapes that come with Repent Online. The command line arguments are:


1) is this a repent online n3shape? (0 = no, 1 = yes)

2) the name of the n3shape file

3) which n3pmesh of this n3shape should be displayed? (the two examples only have 1 mesh but some n3shapes have more)


Let me know if you have any questions!
